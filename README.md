# Cache

## Description
Created in Spring 2021. This project involves implementing a simulation of a memory subsystem comprising main memory, L2 cache, L1 cache, and a memory subsystem controller for controlling the interaction among the caches, memory, and CPU. 
In this simulated system data is written to and read from the L2 cache as entire 8-word cache lines, not individual words which are 32 bits.
